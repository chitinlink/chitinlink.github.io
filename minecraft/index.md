## Ammonite Minecraft Server

<!-- <div style="text-align: center"><a class="fat" href="map">Server Map</a></div> -->

### The server will launch on September 2nd at 6PM UTC! Check #events and #monster-energy-500ml

We are playing **1.19.2 vanilla\*** survival multiplayer Minecraft.

We will update to newer versions as the important mods the server uses get updated. This might mean a few months of lag behind Minecraft updates.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Server rules</summary>

1. No griefing in general
  * Don't destroy player-built landscapes and structures.
  * (Check the allowed exploits under Technical Details)
2. Don't litter -- Make the map look better and definitely don't make "it worse. e.g.:
  * Permanent Dirt pillars/bridges
  * Floating trees
  * Creeper holes
3. Don't lag out the server. Examples:
  * Stray minecarts
  * Animal pens with too many animals
  * Abusing `/player`
  * Unannounced TNT-duping, chunk-loaders, etc
  * Exceptions can be made, ask in advance for one.

</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Ways in which the server differs from vanilla</summary>

* [Spawn chunks](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Spawn_chunk) are turned off, meaning a player must be around for things to happen.
* You may spawn players with carpet mod's `/player` command.
* No villages will generate. To obtain villagers you will have to cure zombie villagers or breed existing ones.
* Sleeping is disabled. So is [Insomnia](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Insomnia).
* If there are no players online, overworld daytime ticks are paused.
* Endermen cannot pick up blocks, to prevent them from griefing.
* Maps update in your inventory without you needing to hold them.
* Empty shulker boxes stack up to 64 when dropped on the ground.

Note also that the game is on Hard difficulty, with `keepInventory` off.

We have the syncmatica mod on the server, meaning you can share your litematica schematics with other players.  
I highly recommend designing things in Creative mode before building them in Survival on the server. It makes your life much easier.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Statement on Minecraft's Chat Reporting feature</summary>

This server is running [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports) to curb the new chat reporting feature.

This mod strips the cryptographic signatures attached to messages before relaying them to clients, so if you don't also have the mod installed on your client, you will see a "Not Secure" warning on messages sent to you. My modpack below includes the mod.

</details>

To join the server, please ask to be whitelisted first.

I recommend using my pre-made modpack, but you can join on a vanilla client.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Client Modpack</summary>

1. Install [MultiMC Launcher](https://multimc.org/)
2. Open MultiMC
3. Add Instance > Import from zip > Paste in this URL: `https://x.chitin.link/share/etc/mcme500/latest.zip`

<details markdown="1"><summary>Gamerules</summary>

Gamerules (that are changed from defaults):

| `disableElytraMovementCheck` |  `true`

</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Carpet mod options</summary>

We're using these Carpet options:

`stackableShulkerBoxes`
: Empty shulker boxes stack up to 64 when dropped.

`flippinCactus`
: You can flip and rotate blocks when holding a cactus.

`spawnChunksSize 0`
: Spawn chunks are disabled altogether for performance and to obviate the need for digging them out.

`xpNoCooldown`
: XP is absorved with no delay.

`commandPlayer`
: Enables the `/player` command which can be used to simulate a player. This is for if you want to AFK on a farm. Misuse will result in a ban.

... plus a number of fixes and optimizations

</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Datapacks</summary>

We have these datapacks installed on the server:

No Villages
: Completely removes villages from the game. Villagers can still be obtained by curing zombie villagers.

No Enderman Griefing
: Endermen cannot pick up blocks. This prevents them from griefing terraformed areas.

Fast Leaf Decay
: Leaves decay much faster after chopping the wood they were attached to.

AFK Display
: Players who are AFK will be greyed out on the player list.

</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Allowed exploits</summary>

Please check with me if you want to do an exploit. Here's a list of exploits that are allowed on the server:

TNT-duping 
: Don't do it anywhere near player structures, get at least 2000 blocks out from the spawn or ask me if you want to do it somewhere closer.

Bedrock-breaking
: Freely in the Nether as long as it isn't ugly, ask for permission in the Overworld and the End.

RNG manipulation
: Freely for enchantments, otherwise ask.
