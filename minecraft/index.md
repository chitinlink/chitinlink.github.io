## Minecraft

<div style="text-align: center"><a class="fat" href="map">Server Map</a></div>

### Basic info

You must be whitelisted to join, ask me about it.  
You can use the regular Minecraft launcher if you want.  
We are playing **1.15.2** vanilla Minecraft.

If you want something you made to have a tooltip on the server map, ask for it.

There is no specific goal to the server, you can just do whatever as long as you follow the rules.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Server rules</summary>

1. No griefing in general
  * Don't destroy player-built landscapes and structures.
  * (Check the allowed exploits under Technical Details)
2. Don't litter -- don't make the map look bad. Examples:
  * Dirt pillars/bridges
  * Floating trees
3. Don't lag out the server. Examples:
  * Animal pens with too many animals
  * Stray minecarts
  * Always-on machines
  * Exceptions can be made, ask in advance for one.

#### ⚠️ 1.16.2 Update **AND** Nether reset ⚠️

We're postponing updating until 1.16.2, and when it comes we'll reset the Nether as well.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Technical details</summary>

Map was originally generated in `1.14`. We then played on `1.14.1`, `1.14.2`, `1.15`, and now in `1.15.2`.

[Seed](https://chunkbase.com/apps/biome-finder#-1801724948): `-1801724948`

The server is technically not vanilla, but the mods we have are for performance and enhancing the vanilla game:

* [Carpet mod](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) and [carpet-extra](https://github.com/gnembon/carpet-extra/)

I plan to keep updating the server as new **stable** versions come out, and the world will always be the same. (**We WILL reset the Nether for 1.16 though so be warned**)

Backups are done every day at [5AM UTC](https://time.is/just/UTC). The server lives somewhere in the Madeira archipelago.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Datapacks</summary>

We have these datapacks installed on the server:  
(from [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/))

Nether Portal Coords

<details markdown="1"><summary>Allowed exploits</summary>

Please check with me if you want to do an exploit. Here's a list of exploits that are allowed on the server:

TNT-duping 
: don't do it near player structures, get at least 2000 blocks out from the spawn or ask me if you want to do it somewhere closer

Bedrock-breaking
: Freely in the Nether as long as it isn't ugly, ask for permission in the Overworld and the End

RNG manipulation
: Freely for enchantments, otherwise ask
