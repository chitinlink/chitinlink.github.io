<div style="text-align: center"><a class="fat" href="map">Server Map</a></div>

### Basic info

We are playing **1.19 vanilla** survival multiplayer Minecraft.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Server rules</summary>

1. No griefing in general
  * Don't destroy player-built landscapes and structures.
  * (Check the allowed exploits under Technical Details)
2. Don't litter -- don't make the map look bad. Examples:
  * Dirt pillars/bridges
  * Floating trees
3. Don't lag out the server. Examples:
  * Animal pens with too many animals
  * Stray minecarts
  * Always-on machines
  * Exceptions can be made, ask in advance for one.

</details>

To join the server, please ask to be whitelisted first.

I recommend using my pre-made modpack, but you can join on a vanilla client.

2. Open MultiMC
3. Add Instance > Import from zip > Paste in this URL: `https://x.chitin.link/share/etc/mc2022/latest.zip`

<details markdown="1"><summary>Carpet mod options</summary>

We're using these Carpet options:

`stackableShulkerBoxes`
: Empty shulker boxes stack up to 64 when dropped

`flippinCactus`
: You can flip and rotate blocks when holding a cactus

`spawnChunksSize 0`
: Spawn chunks are disabled altogether for performance and to obviate the need for digging them out.

`xpNoCooldown`
: XP is absorved with no delay.

`commandPlayer`
: Enables the `/player` command which can be used to simulate a player. This is for if you want to AFK on a farm. Misuse will result in a ban.

... plus a number of fixes and optimizations

<details markdown="1"><summary>Datapacks</summary>

We have these datapacks installed on the server:

No Villages
: Completely removes villages from the game. Villagers can still be obtained by curing zombie villagers.

No Enderman Griefing
: Endermen cannot pick up blocks. This prevents them from messing with terraformed areas.

Fast Leaf Decay
: Leaves decay much faster after chopping the wood they were attached to.

AFK Display
: Players who are AFK will be greyed out on the player list.

</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Allowed exploits</summary>

Please check with me if you want to do an exploit. Here's a list of exploits that are allowed on the server:

TNT-duping 
: don't do it anywhere near player structures, get at least 2000 blocks out from the spawn or ask me if you want to do it somewhere closer

Bedrock-breaking
: Freely in the Nether as long as it isn't ugly, ask for permission in the Overworld and the End

RNG manipulation
: Freely for enchantments, otherwise ask
