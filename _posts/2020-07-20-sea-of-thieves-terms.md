## On directions

When referring to **things *close* to the ship**, like floating debris or swimming pirates, refer to them using the terms *front*, *back*, *port*, and *starboard*.  
When referring to **things *far away* from the ship**, mainly other ships in the horizon, but also shipwrecks, islands, etc., refer to them using the cardinal directions on your compass. 

## Common orders and terms

"Full canvas"
: Lower all sails.

"Half mast"
: Refers to having the sails about halfway raised.

"Manage sails"
: Rotate all sails so they catch the wind better.

"Shoreleave"
: When you're given shoreleave, it means you're allowed to do whatever in the island you're parked at.

## Notes

This is intended for gameplay and is not entirely accurate to real life nautical terms. For instance, the hind mast is actually called a *mizzenmast*.
