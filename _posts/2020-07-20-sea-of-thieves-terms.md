## On directions

When referring to **things *close* to the ship**, like floating debris or swimming pirates, refer to them using the terms *front*, *back*, *port*, and *starboard*.  
When referring to **things *far away* from the ship**, mainly other ships in the horizon, but also shipwrecks, islands, etc., refer to them using the cardinal directions on your compass. 

## Common orders and terms

"Full canvas"
: Lower all sails.

"Half mast"
: Refers to having the sails about halfway raised.

"Manage sails"
: Rotate all sails so they catch the wind better.

"Shoreleave"
: When you're given shoreleave, it means you're allowed to do whatever in the island you're parked at.

"Broadside" (verb)
: *Broadsiding* a ship means firing on it from the side. It's important because cannon fire has to be coordinated and uninterrupted to win damage trades.

"Windward" and "Leeward"
: The direction the wind blows in and the one opposite that, respectively. In the context of directions, *wind* and *lee* are also good.

## Notes

This is intended for gameplay and is not entirely accurate to real life nautical terms. For instance, the hind mast is actually called a *mizzenmast*.

We use *port* and *starboard* instead of *left* and *right* with regards to the ship because it's faster. "Left of us" is the same as "portside" because you're saying *us* to refer to the ship.  
You're better served using two dedicated terms for those directions. That way, when someone says "to the left", you can look to your left knowing that if they meant the ship's left they'd have said "portside".  
In some situations, you might still use "left" and "right", for instance if you say "turning left" this is fine. What else would you turn besides the ship?
