## Minecraft

### Basic info

You must be whitelisted to join, ask me about it.  
You can use the regular Minecraft launcher if you want.

There is no specific purpose to the server, you can just do whatever as long as you follow the rules:

1. No griefing in general
  * (Check the allowed exploits under Technical Details)
2. Don't litter -- don't make the map look bad. Examples:
  * Dirt pillars/bridges
  * Floating trees
3. Don't lag out the server. Examples:
  * Animal pens with more than 10 animals
  * Stray minecarts
  * Always-on redstone machines

Ask if you want to break rule 3 for something. My answer will probably be to do it somewhere far away.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Technical details</summary>

The server is technically not vanilla, but the mods we have are for performance and enhancing the vanilla game:

  * [Carpet mod](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) and [carpet-extra](https://github.com/gnembon/carpet-extra/)

I plan to keep updating the server as new **stable** versions come out, and the world will always be the same. (**We WILL reset the Nether for 1.16 though so be warned**)

Backups are done every day at [4AM UTC](https://time.is/just/UTC). The server lives in New York, USA.

We're using these Carpet options:

`flippinCactus`
: You can flip and rotate blocks when holding a cactus

`horseWanderingFix`
: Horses don't wander away

`kelpGenerationGrowthLimit 0`

... plus a number of fixes and optimizations

<details markdown="1"><summary>Datapacks</summary>

We have these datapacks installed on the server:  
(from [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/))

Nether Portal Coords
: Adds `/trigger nc_inNether` and `/trigger nc_inOverworld` for determining corresponding coordinates in the Nether for syncing up portals

Villager Death Messages
: Writes a message to chat when a villager dies or is converted to a zombie villager

<details markdown="1"><summary>Allowed exploits</summary>

Please check with me if you want to do an exploit. Here's a list of exploits that are allowed on the server:

TNT-duping 
: don't do it near player structures, get at least 2000 blocks out from the spawn or ask me if you want to do it somewhere closer

Bedrock-breaking
: Freely in the Nether as long as it isn't ugly, ask for permission in the Overworld and the End

RNG manipulation
: Freely for enchantments, otherwise ask
