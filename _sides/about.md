## about me

My timezone is more or less [UTC](https://time.is/just/UTC).

I'm more active on Discord than anywhere else. If you want my tag, ask me in private.  
I spend a lot of my free time in calls, doing whatever in the background.

I'm agender, please refer to me in the 2nd person using "they" pronouns. I'm also pansexual and polyamorous, if that matters to you.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Webcomics</summary>
I'm keeping up with a number of webcomics atm:

- [Gunnerkrigg Court](https://www.gunnerkrigg.com/?p=1)

I'm a huge fan of format-breaking and hypertext stuff - the flashes in Homestuck, nonlinear storytelling (eg. SCP)

I track the games I'm playing at [Backloggery](https://backloggery.com/technoabyss).

I don't do it on purpose, but I end up changing the game I'm focusing on every few weeks.

Here's some I usually come back to:

- TF2 (I like jump maps)
- Elite Dangerous
- Minecraft (usually vanilla)

I really like Source-style movement. I'm waiting for [Momentum Mod](https://www.momentum-mod.org/) to come out...

Here's some I really like:

- Hollow Knight
- Ratz Instagib 2.0
- Terraria
- Nuclear Throne
- Lethal League / Blaze
- Cavestory
