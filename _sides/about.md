## about me

My timezone is more or less [UTC](https://time.is/just/UTC).

I'm more active on Discord than anywhere else: `chitinlink#6078`  
I spend a lot of my free time in calls, doing whatever in the background.

I'm agender, so please use they/them, he/him, or she/her pronouns. Please don't mix them in sentences.

My interests include compulsive computer use, and videogames. I watch a movie every week with my friends.

I keep track of videogames I have played, podcasts I've listened to, movies I've watched, etc. here:
