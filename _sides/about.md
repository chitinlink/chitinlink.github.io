## about me

My timezone is more or less [UTC](https://time.is/just/UTC).

I'm more active on Discord than anywhere else. If you want my tag, ask me in private.  
I spend a lot of my free time in calls, doing whatever in the background.

I'm agender, so please use they/them, he/him, or she/her pronouns. Please don't mix them in sentences.

Note: This webpage will be updated when I've finished rewriting my website.

I keep track of videogames I have played, podcasts I've listened to, movies I've watched, etc. here:
