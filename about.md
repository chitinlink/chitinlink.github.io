## about me

My timezone is more or less [UTC](https://time.is/just/UTC).

I'm more active on Discord than anywhere else. If you want my tag, ask me in private. Same thing for my Steam account.  
I spend a lot of my free time in calls, doing whatever in the background.

I'm agender. Because the english language is gendered, and for the sake of unencumbering speech, I use "she" and "her" pronouns and prefer to be addressed with feminine forms. You're free to call me a "girl" and so on if you like. I'm also pansexual and polyamorous, if that matters to you.

I'm not well-read on politics but I agree with most communist and anti-imperialist rhetoric.  
I believe everyone has a right to be treated fairly -- to be fed and clothed, to stable housing and infrastructure, and allowed to flourish without undue stress.

I'm [available for web design work](https://twitter.com/technoabyss/status/1222519819146334208) if you're interested in that.

I like SCP quite a bit. My favorite entry is [taboo](http://www.scp-wiki.net/taboo).

I'm a huge fan of format-breaking and hypertext stuff - the flashes in Homestuck, nonlinear storytelling (eg. SCP)

I really like Source-style movement. I'm waiting for [Momentum Mod](https://www.momentum-mod.org/) to come out...

Here's some I really like:

- Hollow Knight
- Ratz Instagib 2.0
- Terraria
- Nuclear Throne
