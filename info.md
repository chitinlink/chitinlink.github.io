## Info

I'm more active on Discord than anywhere else. If you want my tag, ask me in private. Same thing for my Steam account.  
I spend a lot of my free time in calls, doing whatever in the background.

I'm [available for web design work](https://twitter.com/technoabyss/status/1222519819146334208) if you're interested in that.

I haven't read that many traditional books lately, save for the Dune series. I'm in the middle of God Emperor right now.

I like SCP quite a bit. My favorite entry is [taboo](http://www.scp-wiki.net/taboo).

<details markdown=1><summary>Webcomics</summary>

I'm keeping up with a number of webcomics atm:

- [Gunnerkrigg Court](https://www.gunnerkrigg.com/?p=1)
- [Dumbing of Age](http://www.dumbingofage.com/2010/comic/book-1/01-move-in-day/home/)
- [Prequel](https://www.prequeladventure.com/2011/03/prequel-begin/)
- [Kill Six Billion Demons](https://killsixbilliondemons.com/comic/kill-six-billion-demons-chapter-1/)
- [Gather Ye Power](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/gather-ye-power/list?title_no=327553&page=1)

I also read these at some point:

- [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com/) (Finished)
- [Sandra and Woo](http://www.sandraandwoo.com/2000/01/01/welcome-to-sandra-and-woo/) (Dropped midway)
- Walkyverse<sup>([what is this?](https://walkypedia.fandom.com/wiki/Walkyverse))</sup> (Finished all of these) 
  - Roomies!
  - It's Walky!
  - Joyce and Walky!
  - Shortpacked!
- [Order of the Stick](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html) (Dropped midway)
- [Harpy Gee](https://harpygee.com/comic/cover) (Dropped midway)

I'm a huge fan of format-breaking and hypertext stuff - the flashes in Homestuck, nonlinear storytelling (eg. SCP)
